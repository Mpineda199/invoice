This is a program to help people who go shopping every day, and we have to register the purchase invoices, we register the invoices in the program through the terminal and they are saved in an Excel document where we can send it to our email.

    You'll need to replace "your_email@gmail.com" and "your_password" with your Gmail email and password for sending the email. Make sure to enable "Less secure    apps" in your Gmail account settings, or use an App Password if you have 2-step verification enabled.
    The script sends the Excel file as an attachment in the email.
    I also added alignment formatting for the header row to center-align the text.
